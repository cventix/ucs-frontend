    title: 'The Chinese Electric Vehicle Market',
    description: `The future of the automobile industry will be electric, and China dominates both manufacturing and adoption. Tesla's domestic production capability shows that China will be the epicenter of global EV competition. When combined with stratospheric valuations, few would argue that the Chinese EV sector isn't one of the hottest corporate stories of the new decade. What does China's dominance mean for the future of the electric vehicle industry?`,

    title: 'Chinese Data Centers',
    description: `Data is the new oil, and the new oil needs storage containers. If you drive an electric car for one hour, it produces approximately four terabytes of new data. Data that's being created from image recognition, IoT devices, and the e-commerce revolution and it all needs to be stored. China's data center sector is different from the US in several waysâ€”Telecom is dominant, the consumer vs. enterprises has driven the technology boom, there are numerous regulatory barriers to entry, and China is at an early stage of development compared to the US. That said, China's data center market has tripled since 2015 and shows no signs of slowing down.`,

    title: 'Year In Review',
    description: `2020 was an unpredictable year for the US-China relationship. It ended with a new American President, the implementation of a new trade deal, and an upheaval of the global economy due to COVID-19. China has the upper hand economically with its handling of the pandemic, yet is dealing with the fallout of the trade dispute and the vulnerabilities generated by the semiconductor embargo, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and its regulatory clampdown on its technology giants. Crosscurrents abound as the Biden administration formulates its strategy on how to manage growing Chinese influence. Our panelists provided their analysis and insights on the impact of 2020 on the future of the US-China economic, technology, investment, and geopolitical relationship.`,

    title: 'Chinese Fintech',
    description: `China has leapfrogged the United States to become the undisputed global fintech hub. The speed, sophistication, and scale of China's fintech development is unmatched and attributed to Its high national mobile internet penetration, a large e-commerce ecosystem, its dominant mega-tech companies, and traditionally accommodative regulations. Since the Ant Financial clampdown, Chinese authorities are exploring ways to tighten regulation. Will stricter regulations hinder China's fintech sector growth?`,

    title: 'The Strategic Implications of the China EU Investment Deal',
    description: `Towards the end of 2020, the European Union and China concluded negotiations for the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI). This deal strengthens ties between Beijing and Brussels at a pivotal moment for the Biden administration, which is indicating that the United States will end unilateralism and seek a united front with the EU, Japan, and other democratic allies in its trade fight with China. The CAI has potentially halted that opportunity.`,
