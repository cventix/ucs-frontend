              {' '}
              for many global B2B SaaS/cloud companies. However, due to China’s complex regulatory environment there is
              confusion around the meaning of “SaaS” in China, and what is even possible for foreign companies. When
              SaaS companies explore China and discuss their business and options, they will often receive feedback
              like, “China is hard for SaaS companies, you will need to replicate your cloud infrastructure and get a
              commercial ICP licenses that can only be obtained by a controlling China partner.” Though there are cases
              where this is true, for the majority of companies — particularly those in the world of enterprise SaaS —
              there are often significantly easier paths to enter China.

              This article seeks to demystify some of the issues around SaaS in China and discuss key considerations
              when entering the market. Most importantly, we’ll share how companies can build a go-to-market (GTM) plan
              for China that is compliant and starts with a smaller footprint, allowing companies to delay larger
              investments until after they have achieved their business milestones.

              so difficult for so many Western companies, and why is it so important? On the face of it, it shouldn’t be
              so difficult. China has been open to the world for decades, and the options at the highest level are
              straightforward and familiar to seasoned global executives. The challenge is that very few companies (or
              their China advisors) possess the combined strategic and operational experience necessary to help a
              cloud/SaaS company understand the interplay of their GTM plans across strategy, IT architecture, finance
              and compliance, while also knowing how other companies have addressed similar issues in China.

          <p>
            <strong>
              Having the correct GTM plan can be the difference between generating revenues in months instead of years.
              The correct plan could also potentially allow a company to leverage its current global infrastructure,
              versus having to build an entirely independent China cloud. Companies can build their GTM plans to avoid
              strategies that force them into low chance/high risk activities, such as negotiating a complex joint
              venture or using questionable legal structures to circumvent Chinese regulations.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              A good GTM strategy is key to finding solutions to the following common concerns from executives:
            </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>How do we start small and invest over time based on real market traction?</li>
            <li>
              How do we avoid missing something obvious when building a plan, then find out 6 months after entry that
              the plan had no chance of success in the first place?
            </li>
            <li>How do we make sure the strategy meets our desired compliance parameters?</li>
            <li>How do we determine when a local partner is a good choice or should be avoided?</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Where to start</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Companies typically start their China journey by speaking with their lawyers, advisors, potential
              partners, and other experts to discuss the market opportunity and their high-level entry options. The
              initial review usually starts by discussing the company’s existing business outside the China market. The
              company will also ask its lawyers to identify potential risks, where they may need licenses, and some of
              the ways similar companies have approached the market.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Unfortunately, for companies that define and describe themselves as SaaS companies, this can quickly lead
              them down a rabbit hole. SaaS in China has taken on a very specific and unintended meaning from a
              regulatory perspective. This misconception perhaps stems from believing that because a few well-known
              global SaaS products (including Microsoft Office 365 and Amazon) were subject to strict regulatory
              scrutiny in China and had to obtain commercial ICP licenses through the Chinese partner route, all SaaS
              companies must follow suit. However, just because a company operates a cloud or has a recurring
              subscription model, does not mean it needs a partner and a commercial ICP license.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Nevertheless, companies often hear this advice or misinterpret how China’s regulatory environment works.
              This leads many to go down a decision path where they become absorbed in complex discussions for strategic
              partnerships they often prefer to avoid, or to explore “creative” structuring options that can introduce
              significant risk into the overall China business case. This eventually leads far too many companies to
              walk away from China frustrated, while at the same time wondering how so many other companies have
              successfully entered the market.
            </strong>

          <h3>Alternate paths to enter China</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
              There is no one-size-fits all solution when it comes to GTM planning for companies looking to deploy SaaS
              in China. Companies need to understand that their initial review should only be the starting point; it is
              the straw man from which to start developing a GTM strategy.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              Every company has its own objectives, timing and budget constraints, risk appetite, and flexibility around
              business strategies and models it will be willing to consider in China. There are real choices for
              companies to enter the China market in a staged fashion and prove-out their business with a much lower
              investment. In many cases, companies will eventually operate a slightly different business in China than
              their global business. This may let them permanently avoid areas that involve a more stringent regulatory
              environment. In other cases, companies will eventually choose to go all-in with a local Chinese partner —
              but only after they are more confident about the market and have a significantly strengthened negotiating
              position.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>
              To identify the right GTM plan for China requires a highly iterative process where companies take a deep
              look at every aspect of their business. This process can sometimes feel costly or premature as this type
              of analysis is usually done later, after companies have confirmed their high-level GTM plan and allocated
              the budget for their China effort. However, this process is a must for SaaS company executives who need to
              understand their choices earlier to reduce the “unforced errors” that so often occur to companies that
              copy and paste their global expansion playbooks into China.
